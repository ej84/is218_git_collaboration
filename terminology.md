# Terminology  
1. Repository: Basic element of GitHub and can be considered the folders for a project. 
A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. 
Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.  
2. Clone: A copy of a repository that lives on a local computer rather than on a website's server.
Changes made to this local copy can be pushed to the remote version.  
3. Fork: A copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. This allows you to make changes
without affecting the original upstream repository. Forks can also be kept up to date with the
latest changes using a pull request.  
4. Branch: A parallel version of a repository. A branch exists and can be modified without
affecting or disrupting the main branch. Changes made in a branch can be merged back into
the main branch.  
5. Commit: An individual change to a file (or set of files), also known as a 'revision'. When a commit is made, 
Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the 
specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message 
which is a brief description of what changes were made.  
6. Merge: To take changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and apply them into another.
Merges often occur as a 'pull request'. Merges can be done the command line or the GitHub website itself.
