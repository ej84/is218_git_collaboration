<h1>The GitFlow Work</h1>
<br>
 <h2>What is GitFlow and How it Works?</h2>
 <p>GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It suits very well for collaboration and scaling the development team. GitFlow has four key benefit for its users.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>Benefits of Using GitFlow</h2>
 <ol>
  <li><strong>Easy for Parallel Development</strong>
  Using GitFlow makes parallel development very easy by isolating new development from finished work. New development (such as features and non-emergency bug fixes) is done in feature branches, and is only merged back into main body of code if the developer is happy that the code is ready for release. Although interruptions are a BadThing(tm), if you are asked to switch from one task to another, all you need to do is commit your changes and then create a new feature branch for your new task. When that task is done, just checkout your original feature branch and you can continue where you left off.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Good Collaboration</strong>
  Feature branches also make it easier for two or more developers to collaborate on the same feature, because each feature branch is a sandbox where the only changes are the changes necessary to get the new feature working. That makes it so much easy to see and follow what each collaborator is doing.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Releasing Staging Area</strong>
  As new development is completed, it gets merged back into the develop branch, which is a staging area for all completed features that haven’t yet been released. So when the next release is branched off of develop, it will automatically contain all of the new stuff that has been finished.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Safe and Great Support for Emergency Fixes</strong>
  GitFlow supports hotfix branches - branches made from a tagged release. You can use these to make an emergency change, safe in the knowledge that the hotfix will only contain your emergency fix. There’s no risk that you’ll accidentally merge in new development at the same time.</li>
</ol>
